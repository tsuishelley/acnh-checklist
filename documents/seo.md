I feel like the most important thing I learned about SEO optimization was the importance of h1 tags and ensuring that you aren't overusing them. While that's the most important thing I learned as something I can take with myself for future site development, I do think that the most interesting thing I learned regarding this space is that companies like Google will often update their algorithm every few months. Not only that, but developers looking to try and "game" the system by creating ghost pages or hidden text might actually be penalized for doing so by having their SEO score drop.

For me personally, some actionable steps I'll take to improve SEO for my site will be to ensure that I'm only using one h1 tag across all pages. If I had any more time, I would love to add OpenGraph images and Webclip images to make it more visible when sharing our with others. I also think using heat maps would be really interesting to see what people value more â€” tracking what bugs they've caught or tracking what fish they've caught. I also think it would be cool to use this information in the future to visualize the what bugs/fish people are catching first/most often and seeing if it tracks correctly with their intended rarity.
