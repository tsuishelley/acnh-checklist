        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>This site was created as a final project for the UW Certificate in Front-End Development by myself, Shelley Tsui.

Thank you so much to my instructure for Aaron for all the kind help, September Works for providing me with the opportunity to learn front-end development, and most importantly my husband Christian for supplying me with endless mugs of tea and snacks throughout all three courses.</p>
